# Belly Up

## Description
> 
The worldd is haunted by a problem. A problem that has existed throughout the ages, and which is only finally beginning to be acknowledged.
I speak, of course, of stomachs without tattoos around their belly button. The world is awash with bare tummies because nobody can come up with a tattoo that will let them use their navel as the "O" in the script of their tattoo.

I aim to solve this problem.

Belly Up works in two ways:
The first: Gathering a random word that contains an "O"
The second: Removing the "O" from the word, and placing the remaining letters in the appropriate location on either side of the navel.

Upon arrival at the homepage, users are presented with an example of the tattoo simulator. Users can change the font or belly model for the tattoo right from the homepage, and upon logging in with google, they can save particular favorites, as well as go back and update or remove previously saved tattoo results.
