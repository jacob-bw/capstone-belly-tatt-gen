* Why are click events on `saved` page not working?
* once I fix these two click events, I will be both done with MVP and full crud

<!-- *done* also hide `save` button when not authed  -->

### only non-crucial styling elements that remain:
* center text on tattoo card on img not on card-size itself. this 
* center buttons on navbar
* get navbar toggle menu to work
^ these *should* be the last few tweaks necessary to have site fully optimized for mobile as well. 
* add footer?
* toggle book button depending on route/page
