### Why are click events on saved page not working?
### once I fix these two click events, I will be both done with MVP and full crud
* all my stuff is gonna be in tattooCard.js, savedData.js (maybe?), Word.js, and Saved.js

* I moved the img change component out of navbar and onto the tattoo card, I may have forgotten something?
<!-- *done* also hide `save` button when not authed  -->

### only non-crucial styling elements that remain:
* center text on tattoo card on img not on card-size itself.
* center buttons on navbar
* add footer?
* toggle book button depending on route/page
